PersonalDB
==========
PersonalDB is a relational database based on Harvard Computer Science 165's 
semester-long database project. It is a custom, command-line database that 
supports the major functionality of MySQL including table creations, updates, 
fetches, joins, and other operations for integers.

Timeline
========
I am currently rewriting this project from scratch. My goal is to have this project done near
the end of July.

Notes
=====
- .csv files that are being loaded into the database must be in the same directory as server.c.
(This should never be an issue as long as client.c, server.c, and db are in their original
directories)
